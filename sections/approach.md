# How  

*A lab without walls.*

Advances in centralized research infrastructure, cloud computing, and contract research organizations (CROs) make independent, single-PI labs more feasible than ever. OPENEMAGE leverages these advancements:

- **Shared Infrastructure:** Researchers access state-of-the-art facilities and computational resources remotely, eliminating the need for costly, owned equipment.
- **Nonprofit Umbrella:** OPENEMAGE provides essential administrative support, grant eligibility, and a recognized institutional affiliation.
- **Ownership & Autonomy:** Scientists retain full ownership of their intellectual property and data, promoting unhindered collaboration and innovation.

This unique combination of **service-based infrastructure and scientific independence** allows independent labs to perform high-caliber research at scale, without traditional constraints.
