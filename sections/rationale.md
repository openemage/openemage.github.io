## Why Now

**Imaging throughput cracked.** With automated microscopes and synchrotron beamlines large-scale data generation is within reach.

**AI demand is real.** Virtual cell initiatives explicitly call for subcellular spacial biology data, but it doesn't exist at scale. The bottleneck is actively shifting from algorithms to foundational data.

**Distribution infrastructure has matured.** Cloud-native storage, global filesystems, distributed compute environments. Large datasets can now be used without institutional privilege. The access and resources barrier is disappearing.

**We've already proven the model.** [EMPIAR-11830](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/empiar/EMPIAR-11830/), our *Chlamydomonas* cryo-electron tomography dataset, is becoming one of the most-used and [largest open cryo-ET](https://cryoetdataportal.czscience.com/datasets/10302/) [resources](https://www.cell.com/molecular-cell/fulltext/S1097-2765(25)00970-0) in subcellular spatial biology. Labs worldwide are building on it. OPENEMAGE is scaling this approach to human immune cells at scale required for tomorrow's AI Virtual Cells.
