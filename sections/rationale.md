# Why Now  

*Talent shall not wait for independence.*

The current academic system is facing critical challenges that stall innovation:

- **Bottlenecks:** Only about **15%** of new Ph.D. graduates secure tenure-track roles, leaving countless potential Principal Investigators stranded.
- **Lost Talent:** Highly capable scientists outside academia lack support, resulting in isolation and wasted expertise.
- **Funding Inefficiencies:** Institutional bureaucracy and overhead costs significantly dilute research funding, limiting resources that directly reach scientists and their experiments.

These systemic issues urgently demand a new model. OPENEMAGE responds to this pressing need by providing immediate, independent scientific leadership and direct access to resourcesâ€”today.
