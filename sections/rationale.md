## Why Now

**Increasing Imaging Throughput:** With automated microscopes and synchrotron beamlines large-scale data generation is within reach.

**Time-critical Need for Spatial Data for AI:** Virtual cell initiatives explicitly call for subcellular spacial biology data, but it doesn't exist at scale. The bottleneck is actively shifting from algorithms to foundational data.

**Distribution Infrastructure has Matured:** Cloud-native storage, global filesystems, distributed compute environments. Large datasets can now be used without institutional privilege. The access and resources barrier is disappearing.

**We have Already Proven the Model!** Our founding cohort is among the pioneers of[EMPIAR-11830](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/empiar/EMPIAR-11830/). Our [*Chlamydomonas reinhardtii* large-scale cryo-electron tomography dataset](https://cryoetdataportal.czscience.com/datasets/10302/), is becoming one of the most-used and largest open cryo-ET [resource](https://www.cell.com/molecular-cell/fulltext/S1097-2765(25)00970-0) in subcellular spatial biology. Labs worldwide are [building on it](https://cryosagar.openemage.org/datasets/1-EMPIAR-11830). 

At OPENEMAGE, we are scaling this approach to human immune cells at scale required for tomorrow's AI Virtual Cells.
